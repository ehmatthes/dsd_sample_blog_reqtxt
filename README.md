This is a sample Django project for the `django-simple-deploy`. The purpose of this project is to make it easy for people to make trial runs of the `django-simple-deploy`, with nothing more than a `git clone` command to get started.

For more information, see the [Contributing](https://django-simple-deploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/) docs for `django-simple-deploy`.
